                Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a type of ocular disease that can cause blindness due to damaged blood
                vessels in the back of the eye. The causes of DR are high blood pressure and high blood sugar
                concentration, which are very common in modern lifestyles. People with diabetes usually have higher
                risks of developing DR. In fact, one-third of diabetes patients show the symptoms of diabetic
                retinopathy according to recent studies. Therefore, early detection of DR is critical to ensure
                successful treatment. Unfortunately, detecting and grading diabetic retinopathy in practice is a
                laborious task, and DR is difficult to diagnose at an early stage even for professional
                ophthalmologists. As a result, developing a precise automatic DR diagnostic device is both necessary and
                advantageous.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-5">
                Automated DR diagnosis systems take retinal images (fundus images) and yield DR grades. In the common
                retinal imaging dataset of DR, the grades of DR can be categorized into five stages: 0 - no DR, 1 - mild
                DR, 2 - moderate DR, 3 - severe DR, and 4 - proliferative DR. Specifically, the severity of DR is
                determined by taking the numbers, sizes, and appearances of lesions into account. For instance, the
                figure below provides an illustration of five DR grades in the Kaggle DR dataset. As can be seen, the
                characteristics of DR grades are complex in both structure and texture aspects. Therefore, automated
                diagnosis systems are required to be capable of extracting meaningful visual features from retinal
                images for precise DR grading.

                                    The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 29.1 million people
                                    in the US have diabetes and the World Health Organization estimates that 347 million
                                    people have the disease worldwide. Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is an eye disease
                                    associated with long-standing diabetes. Around 40% to 45% of Americans with diabetes
                                    have some stage of the disease. Progression to vision impairment can be slowed or
                                    averted if DR is detected in time, however this can be difficult as the disease
                                    often shows few symptoms until it is too late to provide effective treatment.

                                    SimCLR: a simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations. We
                                    simplify recently proposed contrastive self-supervised learning algorithms without
                                    requiring specialized architectures or a memory bank. In order to understand what
                                    enables the contrastive prediction tasks to learn useful representations, we
                                    systematically study the major components of our framework. We show that (1)
                                    composition of data augmentations plays a critical role in defining effective
                                    predictive tasks, (2) introducing a learnable nonlinear transformation between the
                                    representation and the contrastive loss substantially improves the quality of the
                                    learned representations, and (3) contrastive learning benefits from larger batch
                                    sizes and more training steps compared to supervised learning

                                    DINO, simplifies self-supervised training by directly predicting the output of a
                                    teacher network—built with a momentum encoder—by using a standard cross-entropy
                                    loss. Interestingly, our method can work with only a centering and sharpening of the
                                    teacher output to avoid collapse, while other popular components such as predictor
                                    [28], advanced normalization or contrastive loss add little benefits in
                                    terms of stability or performance. Of particular importance, our framework is
                                    flexible and works on both convnets and ViTs without the need to modify the
                                    architecture, nor adapt internal normalizations.

                                    SwAV is an efficient and simple method for pre-training convnets without using
                                    annotations. Similarly to contrastive approaches, SwAV learns representations by
                                    comparing transformations of an image, but unlike contrastive methods, it does not
                                    require to compute feature pairwise comparisons. It makes our framework more
                                    efficient since it does not require a large memory bank or an auxiliary momentum
                                    network. Specifically, our method simultaneously clusters the data while enforcing
                                    consistency between cluster assignments produced for different augmentations (or
                                    “views”) of the same image, instead of comparing features directly. Simply put, we
                                    use a “swapped” prediction mechanism where we predict the cluster assignment of a
                                    view from the representation of another view. Our method can be trained with large
                                    and small batches and can scale to unlimited amounts of data.
